# Pocket Plumber (Mobile Web)
A tiny, asset-free, Mario-style platformer built for phones. Runs in any modern mobile browser (Safari/Chrome). On-screen buttons included.

## How to play
- **Open `index.html`** on your phone. If you can't open local files, host the folder on any static server (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or your router's simple server).
- Tap **▶** to start/pause.
- Use **◀ ▶** to move and **⤒** to jump.
- Collect coins, stomp enemies, reach the flag.

## Notes
- All graphics are simple rectangles to avoid external assets.
- Physics: coyote time, jump buffer, short-hops, one-way platforms.
- If you want more levels or different controls, edit `LEVEL` in `game.js` or ask me to generate more.
